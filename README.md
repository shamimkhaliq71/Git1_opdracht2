My name is Shamim Khaliq age 51 years. I wanted a career change into the IT field and I enrolled for the programm Cloud Engineering. Feeling very excited and a little nerves at the same time. It's the second day and I am finding a it abit hard, to find how things work, but I guess that's part of the learning process.
I already have a bachelors degree in International Business and Management Studies and many many years of work experienc, especially in the education sector. 

I love to keep learning new things to gain more knowledge and keep developping myself. I am very proud of myself and very confident that I will succeed in this choosen new path in my life.
